    xxThis is filler text: As Prospero is making plans to depart from the island, Ariel and Caliban remain in Prosperoâ€™s cell. Caliban is cleaning the cell as instructed when Ariel follows him in hopes heâ€™ll accompany him off the island, to freedom.

ARIEL: Caliban! I have been looking for you.

CALIBAN: Not now, Ariel. I must clean this cell for my master, Prospero. There is too much to do to prepare for his departure. I will not be distracted by you.

ARIEL: [gleefully] Donâ€™t you see, Caliban? We are free at last! After all those nights we spent dreaming about freedomâ€¦well you remember, donâ€™t you? 

CALIBAN: Our freedom? I was never bound to Sycorax. I was her son and she treated me as such. And Prospero is still my master. Have you forgotten? He has been very lenient with me despite my foolishness. And I must obey him. Here, clean this table would you? This room is a mess.

ARIEL: Caliban, you are not listening to me. [snaps fingers. The room is magically cleaned] Prospero is leaving the island. What will you do once heâ€™s gone?

CALIBAN: [pausing] I hadnâ€™t thought of that.
